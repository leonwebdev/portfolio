I had a postgraduate diploma as a full-stack web developer from the PACE University of Winnipeg. Currently, I am  studying at Algonquin College.
During the past two years of studying, I have acquired full experience in web development and server management. By courtesy of multiple instructors, I have developed numerous projects by virtue of what I have learned in these programs.

Especially, to conclude my progress, I took part in launching a fully-functional [e-commerce website](https://ecommerce.leon-web-dev.com) with a team consisting of four members in approximately four weeks. I took responsibility to conduct database table modeling and relationship creating, full User and Advertisement CRUD operations, AWS Ubuntu server configurations, website security arrangements, as well as git workflow management.
